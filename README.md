Aim : Introduction tto sets

### Theory : A set is a built-in Python data type used to store a collection of unique items.

No duplicates are allowed

Order doesn’t matter

Unordered → you can’t access items by index

Unique elements → duplicates are removed automatically

Mutable → you can add/remove items


### Frozensets : A frozenset is an immutable set in Python.

Elements are unique

Order doesn’t matter

You cannot change it after creation (no add/remove)


`remove()`: Removes the data from sets

`add()`: Adds data in sets

`intersection(&)`: Gives common elements as output

`union(|)`: Combines all the elements of all the sets

`difference(-)`: Gives the uncommon elements as output

`symmetric difference(^)`: Gives the uncommon elements as output fro both the sets 


### Problem Statement 1: Unique Event Participants

**Steps:**

1. Create a list of participant names containing duplicates.
2. Convert the list into a set.
3. Display the set to show only unique participants.

### Problem Statement 2: Common Elective Subjects

**Steps:**

1. Create three sets for subjects chosen by students.
2. Use intersection operation to find common subjects.
3. Display the common subjects.

### Problem Statement 3: Students in Sports Clubs

**Steps:**

1. Create two sets for cricket and football club members.
2. Use intersection to find students in both clubs.
3. Use symmetric difference to find students in only one club.
4. Display the results.

### Problem Statement 4: Absent Students

**Steps:**

1. Create a set of all students.
2. Create a set of present students.
3. Use set difference to find absent students.
4. Display the absent students.

### Problem Statement 5: Remove Invalid Course Code

**Steps:**

1. Create a set of valid course codes.
2. Identify the discontinued code.
3. Use `discard()` to remove it from the set.
4. Display the updated set.

Conclusion: Hence we performed all the operation o sets and practiced problems and successfully used all the commands to perfor the desired tasks.
